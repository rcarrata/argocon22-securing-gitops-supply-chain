# ArgoCon 2022 - Securing GitOps Supply Chain with Sigstore and Kyverno

* [ArgoCon 2022 Session - Securing GitOps Supply Chain with Sigstore and Kyverno](https://sched.co/14lxH) 

## Abstract

In this session, we will present how to secure GitOps supply chain by signing and verifying container images within the Argo Workflows pipelines, using open source projects such as Sigstore and Kyverno. 

We will demonstrate how to eliminate security risks on the software supply chain by signing all container images in public or private registries and ensuring no malicious images are deployed in Kubernetes clusters.
